# Mean_Nitrate_Concentration_Drivers_CONUS

Here, the mean nitrate concentrations and the site characteristics of 2061 sites used in the paper "Sadayappan, Kerins, Li" are available.

Nitrate concentrations were downloaded from United States Geological Survey (USGS) Water Data (U.S. Geological Survey, 2016) using the USGS-R dataRetrieval package (Hirsch and De Cicco 2015). Mean nitrate levels were calculated as arithmetic mean for those sites with atleast 10 measurements after removing below detection limit measurements. 

Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow (GAGES II) database (Falcone 2011) was used to get characteristics of the sites.
